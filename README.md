# Summary

![](.gitbook/assets/docs\_1500x500.png)

Welcome to the go-to portal for in-depth information about the BeanEco SmartChain (BESC) platform and ecosystem and how to interact with them!

The BESC documentation is separated into three major parts:

**1.** **BESC Docs**. This part is available in the sections below for anyone who wants to learn more about BESC without going into detail that only developers would usually need to know.

**2.** **Developer docs.** Developers wishing to build on top of BESC and its mobile-centric infrastructure or run validator nodes should consult this portal.

**3. Tutorials.** This part contains various consumer-focused tutorials.
