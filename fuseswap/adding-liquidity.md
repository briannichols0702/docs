# Adding liquidity

**Prerequisites:**

* You should be connected to Besc RPC.
* USDC and BESC should be on Besc network. To learn how to transfer them to Besc network using Fuseswap via Bridge please go through this [**tutorial**](https://docs.bescscan.io/the-fuse-chain/token-bridges/transfer-fuse-using-bridge-on-fuseswap).

**Step 1:**

Navigate to [www.BeanSwap.finance](https://beanswap.finance/) .The interface will look like as shown below



Use **“Connect to a wallet”** on the right hand top corner to connect your wallet with BeanSwap. Once you connect you should be able to see your wallet address and see that you are connected to BeanSwap via Besc network.



  
**Step 2:**

Click on **“Pool”** and then on **“Add liquidity”**. Select BESC as your first token and USDT as the second token from the dropdown. Enter the amount of BESC you want to provide the liquidity for and corresponding amount of USDC that should be added will automatically show up.

You can also see your share of the liquidity pool based on the amount of BESC you want to provide liquidity for.



Click on **“Approve USDT”** and confirm the transaction through your wallet.

\(Note: If this is the first time you are providing liquidity on Fuseswap using the above pairs you will have to approve the spend transaction.\)

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain click on **“Supply”** and approve the transaction. You will receive the liquidity pool tokens on your wallet which can be checked under tokens through [www.bescscan.io](https://bescscan.io/) on your wallet address.

Navigating to **“Pool”** on BeanSwap will also show you list of token pairs with statistics for which you have provided liquidity and other options like add/remove liquidity for that particular token pair as shown below.
