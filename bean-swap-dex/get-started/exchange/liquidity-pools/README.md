# Liquidity Pools

When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited Besc and USDT into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive BESC**-USDT LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the BESC-USDT Liquidity Pool.&#x20;

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.&#x20;

Whenever someone trades on BeanSwap, the trader pays a **3% fee**, **of which 1%** is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.



## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.
