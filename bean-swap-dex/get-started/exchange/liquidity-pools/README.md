# Liquidity Pools

When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited Besc and USDT into a Liquidity Pool, you'd receive BESC**-USDT LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the BESC-USDT Liquidity Pool.&#x20;

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

Providing liquidity gives you a reward in the form of trading fees when people use your liquidity pool.&#x20;

Whenever someone trades on BeanSwap, the trader pays a 0.25% fee, **of which 0.17%** is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 BESC and 10 USDT tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 BESC + 1 USDT
* Someone trades 10 BESC for 10 USDT.
* Someone else trades 10 USDT for 10 BESC.
* The USDT/BESC liquidity pool now has 10.017 BESC and 10.017 USDT.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 BESC + 1.00017 USDT.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the BESC[ Farms](https://beanswap.finance/farms), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.
