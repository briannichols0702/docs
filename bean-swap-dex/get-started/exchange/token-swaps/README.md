# Token Swaps

Token Swaps on BeanSwap are a simple way to trade one BESC20 token for another via automated liquidity pools, and also with market makers when trading BESC20.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **3% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**1%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**1%** - Sent to the BeanSwap Treasury.

**1%** - Sent towards BESC buyback and burn.

The fee is reduced if you are trading a pair available through our BESC.
