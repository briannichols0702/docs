# TheGraph

## Deploying your own subgraph

TheGraph, a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying chain data, supports the Besc Netork.Go to [https://thegraph.com/](https://thegraph.com/) to sign up and create your subgraph.

* Follow the instructions for how to deploy the subgraph
* in `subgraph.yaml`, the network name should be `fuse`
