# Besc Governance

Besc is already a signigicantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Besc validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Besc improvement proposals](https://docs.bescscan.io/general/fips) \(FIPs\).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Besc Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Besc treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis BESC supply \(see the subsection "[BESC Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.bescscan.io/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Besc, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Besc Limited.

Besc Foundation employs the Besc project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://bescscan.io).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Besc. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the Besc tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.  

3\) **Besc Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.bescscan.io/general/fuse-governance/besc-assembly) for more details.
