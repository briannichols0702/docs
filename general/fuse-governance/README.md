# Besc Governance

Besc is already a signigicantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Besc validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt Besc improvement proposals.  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Besc Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Besc treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis BESC supply.
