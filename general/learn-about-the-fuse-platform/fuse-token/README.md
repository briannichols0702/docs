# BeanEco SmartChain Token (BESC)

The BESC token is the native currency of the BeanEco Smart chain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.

## BESC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the BeanEco Smart chain, BESC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Besc to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 10K. The network is growing, currently there are 1 validator. ([https://status.bescscan.io/](https://status.bescscan.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BESC. Which means validators with higher amounts of BESC staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BESC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BESC they wish. They receive a share of the BESC block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BESC is the native currency on BESC, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BESC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BESC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the BESC platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.
