# Bean Swap Dex

## &#x20;Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

PancakeSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on BNB Smart Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market (sources: [1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized) [2](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)).

### Low fees

Why pay more? BeanSwap runs on BeanEco Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, BeanSwap doesnâ€™t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## ðŸ’¸ Earn

> Earn BESC and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Syrup Pools

Stake BESC, earn free tokens. Itâ€™s really that easy.\
New projects join the party frequently, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn CAKE with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn CAKE. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Syrup Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isnâ€™t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).
